This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(caret)
```

```{r}
oilChanges <- c(3,5,2,3,1,4,6,4,3,2,0,10,7,8)
repairs <- c(300, 300, 500, 400, 700, 420, 100, 290,
             475, 620, 600, 0, 200, 50)
miles <- c(20100, 23200, 19200, 22100, 18400, 23400, 
           17900, 19900, 20100, 24100, 18200, 19600, 20800, 
           19700)
```


```{r}
oil <- data.frame(oilChanges, repairs, miles)
View(oil)
```


```{r}
plot(oil$oilChanges, oil$repairs)
```

```{r}
ggplot(oil, aes(x=miles, y=repairs)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
model1 <- lm(formula=repairs ~ oilChanges, data=oil)
summary(model1)
```

```{r}
plot(oil$oilChanges, oil$repairs)
abline(model1)
```
```{r}
#The model suggests that we should do as many oil changes as possible.

#It predicts very low close to 0 repairs if we do 9 or more oil changes, but about $680 if we do no oil changes.
```



```{r}
m <- lm(formula = repairs ~ oilChanges + miles,
        data = oil)
summary(oil)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
